            <h2>Camera Buying Guide</h2>
            <img class="blogImgFormatting" src="https://samueljonesphoto.com/blog-posts/blog-photos/camera-buyers-guide-pic.jpg">
            As Christmas approaches, the number one question I receive from budding 
            photographers and family/friends of photographers is “what camera should 
            I buy?” It's the age old question that every beginner has to ask someone 
            that they believe has the answer. As much as I wish there was a one size 
            fits all camera for every beginner, it's not as simple as telling them a 
            specific camera model to purchase and walk out the door. But, at any skill 
            level, there are a few main factors to think about when purchasing a camera: 
            budget, use case, current camera comparison, and reason. I'll walk you through
             these factors and hopefully help you come to a conclusion as to what camera 
             will best suit your needs. I shoot primarily with Nikon and Fujifilm cameras,
              so I will be using their systems as an example set.<br><br>
            <h3>Budget</h3>
            Budget is the first thing you should have established before you even begin to look at cameras. Your budget can be anything from $250 to $5000. Just make sure you have your budget figured out and stick to it! 
            <br>
            If you are on a tight budget (or even a large budget), I would strongly recommend buying secondhand. Cameras and lenses are like cars, 90% of them depreciate in value immediately after purchasing them new. I would recommend purchasing from KEH, B&H Used, or MPB. I have purchased all of equipment from these stores and have only once had an issue. A well loved film camera I purchased from KEH had a seized shutter after a few uses. I called them about the issue and they overnighted me a nearly brand new replacement at no cost to me.
            <h3>Mirrorless or DSLR?</h3>
            The second most common question I get is mirrorless vs DSLR. I think this debate comes down to how big your budget is. The amount of camera you can get in a secondhand DSLR is really hard to beat. If money is no object or having the latest video specs is important to you, I would recommend going with a mirrorless camera. If you are on a tight budget and want to focus on photography rather than video, I would recommend a DSLR.
            <h3>Use and Expectations</h3>
            What type of pictures are you wanting to take with the camera? Birds in flight? Portraits/weddings? Landscapes? Street photography? Knowing what type of photos you take is the easiest indicator of what specific model of camera you should purchase. It will also help you set your expectations at a reasonable place once you get the camera and start using it. 
            <br>
            It’s also important to think about how much camera weight you are willing to carry around. The worst case scenario for a new photographer getting into the hobby is to purchase a pile of expensive equipment only to leave it in the closet because it’s just too heavy for them to carry around for hours at a time. The Nikon D4 is a beast of a camera. When it released, it was Nikon’s flagship camera that every working professional had and costed a whopping $6,500. Now that mirrorless has taken over, it can be had for as little as $600-$700 in working condition. So why doesn’t every photographer have one? They are huge cameras weighing in at a massive 3 pounds for the body only! Portability matters for most photographers, so 
            <h3>What's your current setup?</h3>
            Consider the camera you are currently using and what features you feel it’s lacking or are inhibiting you from getting the shots you want. I started shooting wildlife with my Nikon D800, a slow portrait and landscape camera, because it was the camera I had at the time. Once I felt like I had reached the point of missing shots because my D800’s focusing system was not fast enough, I determined that purchasing a faster camera was justified. 
            <br>
            This may look different for you if this is your first camera purchase. Most people start taking photos with their cell phone and find the wide angle or lack of user control on most phone cameras limiting. 
            <h3>Good Glass Good Glass Good Glass</h3>
            Lastly, and definitely most importantly, I want to emphasize how important buying good glass is. 95% of image quality comes from the lenses you use. You can spend $9,000 on a Leica M9 camera but if you put a cheap 3rd party lens on it, it will look worse than the guy that spent $200 on an old used camera and $9,000 on the best lenses currently made. Good glass will set you miles ahead of others in image quality, so always opt for high quality lenses over the newest camera body.
